I struggled at first with using GitHub, especially with commits, pushes, and pulls. I made mistakes like forgetting to pull before pushing or committing the wrong files. 
I overcame these problems by practicing more, checking my changes before committing, and learning from GitHub guides and error messages.
Hosting the project on GitHub makes it easy for others to access, view, and use the code online. It also allows multiple people to collaborate, track changes, and share updates quickly.
